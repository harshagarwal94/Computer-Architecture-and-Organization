Data Representation and Computer

Arithmetic
Fixed point representation of numbers-
algorithms for arithmetic operations:
addition- subtraction - multiplication -
division (restoring and non-restoring)-
Floating point representation with IEEE
standards and algorithms for common
arithmetic operations – conversion between
integer and real numbers.
